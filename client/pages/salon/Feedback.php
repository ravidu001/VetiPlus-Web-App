                                    moment we walked in, the staff was welcoming and made 
                                    Bella feel at ease. The salon is spotless, with a fresh

                                    feel comfortable in.
                                    The groomer, Alex, took the time to ask about Bella's grooming 
                                    needs and preferences. They even offered suggestions for her 
                                    coat care based on her breed. The grooming was top-notch; 
                                    Bella's coat was shiny and soft, her nails were perfectly trimmed, 
                                    and she even got a cute little bow that made her look adorable!
                                    I appreciated how well the salon communicated—confirming our 
                                    appointment and sending a reminder on the day. The booking process 
                                    was smooth, and they were accommodating with times that fit my schedule. 
                                    I also loved that they used gentle, pet-friendly products. Bella looked 
                                    fantastic and seemed happy and relaxed afterward.
